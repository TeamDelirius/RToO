Thanks for checking out Rson (Red's Scriptable Obby Notation)! Below are a few notes before we get you going.
  - This is a script abstraction that is specifically tinkered to Obby Creation; though can be used in other places.
  - Every function added is made sure to be compatible with previous version
  - Every function added is validated to be safe in Roblox

So, how do you get RToO set up or updated?
  1) Open up your game with the RToO kit installed
  2) Navigate to the "Rson" module within Replicated Storage (game.ReplicatedStorage.Rson) if you're using a RToO kit, or create a new module script.
  3) Copy and paste the contents Rson.lua into the module script
  4) You're all done!

What if I want to contribute to Rson?
  1) Awesome! It's really easy to do
  2) Head to the Rson.lua file in Git, and click 'edit'
  3) Add your function AFTER TESTING
  4) Commit the changes; and it'll be improved by a moderator.
